0,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:09,00:00:12,"In this lecture, we're going to talk about the text access."
1,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:14,00:00:18,"In the previous lecture, we talked about the natural language content, analysis."
2,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:19,00:00:30,We explained that the state of the are natural language processing techniquesare still not good enough to process a lot of unrestricted text datain a robust manner.
3,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:30,00:00:37,"As a result,bag of words remains very popular in applications like a search engine."
4,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:39,00:00:48,"In this lecture, we're going to talk about some high-level strategies tohelp users get access to the text data."
5,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:48,00:00:55,This is also important step to convert raw big text data into small random data.
6,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:55,00:00:57,That are actually needed in a specific application.
7,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:00:57,00:01:11,"So the main question we'll address here, is howcan a text information system, help users get access to the relevant text data?We're going to cover two complimentary strategies, push versus pull."
8,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:01:12,00:01:19,"And then we're going to talk about two ways to implement the pull mode,querying versus browsing."
9,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:01:20,00:01:22,So first push versus pull.
10,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:01:24,00:01:29,These are two different ways connect the users with the right informationat the right time.
11,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:01:31,00:01:38,"The difference is which takes the initiative,which party takes the initiative."
12,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:01:40,00:01:46,"In the pull mode,the users take the initiative to start the information access process."
13,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:01:47,00:01:53,"And in this case, a user typically would use a search engine to fulfill the goal."
14,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:01:53,00:02:01,"For example, the user may type in the query andthen browse the results to find the relevant information."
15,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:02,00:02:09,So this is usually appropriate forsatisfying a user's ad hoc information need.
16,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:10,00:02:14,An ad hoc information need is a temporary information need.
17,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:14,00:02:22,"For example, you want to buy a product soyou suddenly have a need to read reviews about related product."
18,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:22,00:02:26,"But after you have cracked information, you have purchased in your product."
19,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:26,00:02:30,"You generally no longer need such information, soit's a temporary information need."
20,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:31,00:02:42,"In such a case, it's very hard for a system to predict your need, andit's more proper for the users to take the initiative, andthat's why search engines are very useful."
21,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:42,00:02:48,Today because many people have many information needs all the time.
22,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:48,00:02:52,So as we're speaking Google is probably processing many queries from this.
23,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:52,00:02:55,"And those are all, or mostly adequate."
24,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:55,00:02:56,Information needs.
25,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:57,00:02:59,So this is a pull mode.
26,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:02:59,00:03:07,In contrast in the push mode in the system would take the initiativeto push the information to the user or to recommend information to the user.
27,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:07,00:03:11,So in this case this is usually supported by a recommender system.
28,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:13,00:03:15,Now this would be appropriate if.
29,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:15,00:03:16,The user has a stable information.
30,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:17,00:03:24,For example you may have a research interest in some topic andthat interest tends to stay for a while.
31,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:24,00:03:26,"So, it's rather stable."
32,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:26,00:03:29,Your hobby is another example of.
33,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:29,00:03:38,"A stable information need is such a case the system can interact with you andcan learn your interest, and then to monitor the information stream."
34,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:38,00:03:47,"If the system hasn't seen any relevant items to your interest,the system could then take the initiative to recommend the information to you."
35,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:47,00:03:56,"So, for example, a news filter ornews recommended system could monitor the news stream andidentify interesting news to you and simply push the news articles to you."
36,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:03:59,00:04:08,This mode of information access may be also a property that when this systemhas good knowledge about the users need and this happens in the search context.
37,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:08,00:04:16,"So for example, when you search for information on the weba search engine might infer you might be also interested in something related."
38,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:16,00:04:17,Formation.
39,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:17,00:04:24,"And they would recommend the information to you, so that just reminds you, forexample, of an advertisement placed on the search page."
40,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:27,00:04:34,So this is about the two high level strategies or two modes of text access.
41,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:35,00:04:38,Now let's look at the pull mode in more detail.
42,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:39,00:04:43,"In the pull mode, we can further distinguish it two ways to help users."
43,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:43,00:04:46,Querying versus browsing.
44,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:46,00:04:48,"In querying, a user would just enter a query."
45,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:48,00:04:53,"Typical the keyword query, andthe search engine system would return relevant documents to use."
46,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:04:54,00:05:00,And this works well when the user knows what exactly are the keywords to be used.
47,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:00,00:05:04,"So if you know exactly what you are looking for,you tend to know the right keywords."
48,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:04,00:05:07,"And then query works very well, and we do that all of the time."
49,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:09,00:05:12,But we also know that sometimes it doesn't work so well.
50,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:12,00:05:21,"When you don't know the right keywords to use in the query, oryou want to browse information in some topic area."
51,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:21,00:05:24,You use because browsing would be more useful.
52,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:24,00:05:39,"So in this case, in the case of browsing, the users would simply navigate it,into the relevant information by following the pathssupported by the structures of documents."
53,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:39,00:05:45,So the system would maintain some kind of structures andthen the user could follow these structures to navigate.
54,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:47,00:05:59,So this really works well when the user wants to explore the information spaceor the user doesn't know what are the keywords to using the query.
55,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:05:59,00:06:05,Or simply because the user finds it inconvenient to type in a query.
56,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:05,00:06:12,So even if a user knows what query to type in if the user is using a cellphoneto search for information.
57,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:12,00:06:14,It's still harder to enter the query.
58,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:14,00:06:18,"In such a case, again, browsing tends to be more convenient."
59,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:18,00:06:24,The relationship between browsing and querying is best understood by making andimagine you're site seeing.
60,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:25,00:06:27,Imagine if you're touring a city.
61,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:27,00:06:29,Now if you know the exact address of attraction.
62,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:31,00:06:34,Taking a taxi there is perhaps the fastest way.
63,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:34,00:06:36,You can go directly to the site.
64,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:36,00:06:40,"But if you don't know the exact address, you may need to walk around."
65,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:40,00:06:43,Or you can take a taxi to a nearby place and then walk around.
66,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:44,00:06:48,It turns out that we do exactly the same in the information studies.
67,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:48,00:06:55,"If you know exactly what you are looking for, then you canuse the right keywords in your query to find the information you're after."
68,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:55,00:06:58,"That's usually the fastest way to do, find information."
69,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:06:59,00:07:04,"But what if you don't know the exact keywords to use?Well, you clearly probably won't so well."
70,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:04,00:07:06,You will not related pages.
71,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:06,00:07:14,"And then, you need to also walk around in the information space,meaning by following the links or by browsing."
72,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:14,00:07:16,You can then finally get into the relevant page.
73,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:17,00:07:20,If you want to learn about again.
74,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:20,00:07:36,You will likely do a lot of browsing sojust like you are looking around in some area and you want to see someinteresting attractions related in the same.
75,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:36,00:07:39,[INAUDIBLE].
76,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:39,00:07:50,"So this analogy also tells us that today we have very good support forquery, but we don't really have good support for browsing."
77,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:50,00:07:57,"And this is because in order to browse effectively,we need a map to guide us, just like you need a map to."
78,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:07:57,00:08:04,"Of Chicago,through the city of Chicago, you need a topical map to tour the information space."
79,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:04,00:08:16,So how to construct such a topical map is in fact a very interestingresearch question that might bring usmore interesting browsing experience on the web or in applications.
80,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:19,00:08:26,"So, to summarize this lecture,we've talked about the two high level strategies for text access; push and pull."
81,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:26,00:08:31,"Push tends to be supported by the Recommender System, andPull tends to be supported by the Search Engine."
82,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:31,00:08:36,"Of course, in the sophisticated [INAUDIBLE] information system,we should combine the two."
83,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:38,00:08:41,"In the pull mode, we can further this [INAUDIBLE] Querying and Browsing."
84,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:41,00:08:50,"Again we generally want to combine the two ways to help you assist,so that you can support the both querying nad browsing."
85,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:51,00:08:58,"If you want to know more about the relationship between pull andpush, you can read this article."
86,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:08:58,00:09:05,This give excellent discussion of the relationship between machine filtering andinformation retrieval.
87,Lesson 1.2 Text Access.vtt,00:09:05,00:09:12,Here informational filtering is similar to information recommendation orthe push mode of information access.
